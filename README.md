nfc hardware wallet that is readable, writeable, safe and open.


The main idea is to create a low data script that can be used and edited easily to load onto any nfc device. cards, stickers, etc... 

my first trial will be to use FREE apps on mobile to load cards with code that acts as a hardware wallet. simply open a wallet app, go to "import wallet" and tap the card. 

we may need to create our own wallet as well... if so that will be included in this repository.

wish me and my homies luck.
